## Frequently Asked Questions | FAQ List‚ùì

### 1) What are guarantees?

I can't guarantee that you will find 10 bitcoins or pay off the program in 1 day. BUT I guarantee that if you don't find the wallets within a week, I will pay you!

### 2) Money out of thin air?

As for me, this is one of the most difficult moneys, as I spent a lot of time fixing bugs, writing code, etc. over these 5 years. I worked around the clock and spent many sleepless nights at the monitor. For me, this is a huge work done!

### 3) Is it legal?

Given that most wallets are old forgotten crypto wallets whose owners have most likely forgotten their accesses to them, I think legally. I compare it to looking for gold jewelry by the sea-coast, when people with a device walk around looking for lost rings, earrings, etc., no one can say it's illegal. I think it is the same here!


### 4) Can the software stop working?

For 5 years the software is working stable and without failure, there were small bugs that appeared, but in the technology of work, nothing has changed, and I think it will not change for many years, even if there are some bugs, I'll correct it for free.

### 5) Can I install it on my phone?

No, the software is built for Windows 7 and higher, as an option, you can buy a remote desktop, for $20-30 a month, and install the software there, which will run the program around the clock and farming wallets.

### 6) How much a day will I earn?
 
All as individual as possible. Sometimes a day absolutely nothing finds, even a few days of silence can be, sometimes in a day finds 5-10 wallets at once.
